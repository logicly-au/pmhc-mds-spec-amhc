Practitioner Category is a multi choice field which allows the type of
professionals used in multidisciplinary teams to be recorded against a contact.

The Practitioner Category field is in addition to
the standard PHMC MDS field for identifying a specific practitioner. The
standard model only allows a single practitioner to be recorded against a
contact. The extended process still requires identification of a single
practitioner (intended to be the ‘main’ one) but also allows capturing
the discipline(s) of other practitioners who might be involved. The
discipline (practitioner type) of the main practitioner is already stored
on an existing table and does not need to be added to the new practitioner
categories field.
