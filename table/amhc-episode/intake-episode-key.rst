**This field should only be completed for an episode at the hub provider organisation.
It should be left blank for an episode at an intake organisation.**

This information must be included with the other referral information
provided to the Hub by the Intake organisation.

Episode Keys must be generated by the organisation to be unique at the provider
organisation level and must persist across time. Creation of episode keys in
this way allows clients to be merged (where duplicate Client Keys have been
identified) without having to re-allocate episode identifiers since they can
never clash.

A recommended approach for the creation of Episode Keys is to compute `random
UUIDs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`_.
